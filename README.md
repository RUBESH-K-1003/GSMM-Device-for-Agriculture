# GSMM-Device-for-Agriculture
Now a days it is very difficult to supervise a large area of agricultural land. So to overcome this problem we introduces a new Idea called "Geofencing And Soil Moisture Measuring (GSMM) Device for agriculture. The main objective of this device is to maintain the crop in agricultural field without supervisor for long days. It is easy to supervise the large area of agricultural field without any difficulties. This can be done with the help of some sensors. This device continuously measures the moisture level of the soil in agricultural land. If the moisture of the soil decreases, then the sensor automatically gives signal to "ON" the motor pump which supply water to the crops till the moisture of the soil is required by the crops. Due to heavy rainfall the crops may be affected. If excess of water in agricultural land, it tends to drain the excess of water. This helps to protect the crops from heavy rainfall. Sometimes animals may affect the crops. So, if the animals enter into the agricultural field, it senses the animals and turn on the alarm, through this the people can understand that the animal is get into the field and they take further actions to move off the animals.
